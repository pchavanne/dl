dl
==

dl is my personal ultra light deep learning framework based on **Theano**.
It is highly inspired by **Lasagne** and **keras** I would therefore recommend
considering one or the other in stead of dl.


Its main features are:

* Layers: Base, Input, dense
* optimisation: sgd, momentum, Nesterov momentum, rmsprop
